    This calculator is a labor of love.   
    It's free to use, anonymous, and doesn't mine your data.  
    I'm not trying to get rich from it.
    However, the cost to keep it operational is in the hundreds of dollars per year.
    Not to mention the approximately 2000+ hours I've put into developing it.

<p>
    If you find it useful, I would appreciate your small donation to help cover these costs.  
    <b>A donation of as little as $10 suggested. </b>
