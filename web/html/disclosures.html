<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
At RetirementOdds.com, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. 
Your data is completely anonymous and we do not collect any personally identifiable information (unless you volunteer it in a feedback submittal).
</p>
<p>
Any personal information you do provide will be used solely for the purpose for which it was collected
and will not be shared with or sold to any third parties, except as required by law.

The data that you submit for calculation may be logged securely and anonymously on our servers for the purpose of debugging, 
analyzing user behavior, and improving our website.

<p>
Although we use industry-standard security measures to protect the personal information that you provide to us, no method of transmission
over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

Again, we do not collect or store any personal information that can be used to identify you (such as your name, address, or email address) through our website, 
unless you volunteer it in a feedback submittal.
